# first_personal_site

This is my first attempt at a personal website, using only HTML and CSS. 

Alongside my coursework in the summer of 2020, I decided to teach myself HTML and CSS 
in order to build a personal website. While building the site, I found a real interest 
in web development. I decided to pursue it further by taking a web systems course the 
following semester. After this course, I decided to have another attempt at a personal 
website, which is currently published at the repo "ryanwschmid.com". In the spirit of 
reflecting on growth, I decided to post this site here. This website was published from 
July 2020 - January 2021.
